### Sukshma - A URL Shortening Service Project

> In this paper, we have shown the importance of URL shortening at the time of sharing on various platforms. 
URLs appear to be long, unattractive, on most of the social platforms. They often get broken when shared 
on social media platforms like e-mail and short URLs can come in handy during these times. To shorten an 
Internet Long URL, we proposed a URL shortening service that will take a long Web URL/address and 
creates a shorter URL that will not break when we share on different platforms and make them more
manageable by using flask framework base62 algorithm. In this paper, we have also provided a way that 
helps during digital marketing, social campaigning, and posting by giving the stats of the number of clicks 
made to the shortened URL as it shows the number of people interested in clicking the URL.

### Optimised URL Shortener using Cloud Platform

> Short URLs have become commonplace. Short URLs, which are especially popular in social networking services, 
have witnessed a significant increase in their use in recent years, largely due to Twitter's restriction on message length to 140 
characters. We рrоvidе a first сhаrасterizаtiоn in the usage of short URLs in this рарer. Our specific goal is to create a system 
architecture for short URLs and have an optimized solution of how to use them and as well as their potential impact on web 
performance.
Our project is made while keeping in mind that the generated URL has to be one third the size of a given url. This allows the 
user the functionality to share the URL with multiple individuals. Our system also incorporates the idea of tracking each 
individual shortened URL by the usage of a short code. It gives the user the control over their generated URLs.

### Comparative Analysis of Malicious Detection of Short URLs from Tweets

> Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become fundamental parts of our online lives, and their popularity is increasing at a 
surprising rate every day. Growing popularity of Twitter has attracted the attention of attackers who attempt to manipulate the features 
provided by Twitter to gain some advantage, such as driving Twitter users to other websites that they post as short URLs (Uniform 
Resource Locators) in their tweets. Even short URLs are also used to avoid sharing overly long URLs and save limited text space in 
tweets. Significant numbers of URLs shared in the OSNs are shortened URLs. Despite of its potential benefits from genuine usage, 
attackers use shortened URLs to hide the malicious URLs, which direct users to malicious pages. Although, OSN service providers and 
URL shortening services utilize certain detection mechanisms to prevent malicious URLs from being shortened, research has found that 
they fail to do so effectively. In this paper, we developed mechanism to develop a machine learning classifier which detect malicious short 
URLs. And comparative analysis of detection rate with various classification algorithm, and but also with online detection on Virus 
Total.

### Web of Short URL’s

> Short URLs have become universal. Especially 
popular in social networking services, short URLs have been
seen a compelling increase in their usage over the past years
of URL shortening services, that are replaced long URLs with 
shorter ones and redirect it for the shortened URL to the 
original long URL. As the usage of shortened URLs is 
convenient, shortened URLs have become common. The study 
is based on the traces of short URLs from two different 
perspectives use of a large-scale crawl of URL shortening 
services use of a crawler for twitter messages. The different 
focus we will provide a more in depth analysis in the 
distribution, stability, lifespan and overall use of the short 
URLs
